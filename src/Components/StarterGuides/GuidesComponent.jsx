                    <p>First off, thank you. If you stepped up to this role, an amazing opportunity to make you own world. This has it’s setback though. You now are set on a road that will require a lot of work, decent improv skills, and a greater understanding of the rules.</p>
                    <p>First off, in order to learn the essential rules of D&D you can check the <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/dnd_essentials_rulebook.pdf">Essentials Kit Rulebook</a>, the <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf">Basic Rules</a> for a bit more in-depth explanation or, while it’s not absolutely necessary, I would recommend getting a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0786965622/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0786965622&linkCode=as2&tag=dndtoolbox-20&linkId=5d5ca07e69d5e3868e64e78434e6e717">Dungeon Master’s Guide</a>. It is full of information that might help you deal with harder to run situations. It also has a bunch of magic items along with some information on how to make your own quest. Your other option is to stick with the basic information and then improvise if anything you don’t know comes up. If you do this, make sure to keep consistent throughout your campaign. Regardless of what route you decide, you need a good grasp of the basic rules.</p>
                    <p>Next, you are going to want to either purchase a campaign or create your own. I will recommend using a book because making your own campaign is extremely time consuming and requires quite a bit know-how. I would recommend for your first game, purchase the starter Red Box. It comes with a small adventure, a few pre-generated characters, music for your campaign and all the maps you'll need. It should be more than enough for a start, and it isn’t too expensive.</p>
                    <p>Now you have the rules and an adventure. Now, you need to learn about your characters and get to know your players. While not necessary, I would recommend sitting down with each player and coming up with their backstory. The goal here is to give you, the DM, what you need to know to make the best tailor-made adventure for your players.</p>
                    <p>Next, sit down with your adventure book (or work on your own adventure) and prep for your session. You would probably need at least one hour to prep for a normal game, although using our Red Boxes you'll need a lot less time to prepare it!</p>
                    <p>Finally, you are ready to run your first game! Get out there, make an amazing world, and make sure your players have a blast!</p>

                    <p>If you are going to be a player for a one shot, adventure, or campaign, there are a few things you will absolutely need to know.</p>
                    <p>First off, you need a basic understanding of the rules so take a moment to learn the rules. In order to learn the essential rules of D&D you can check the <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/dnd_essentials_rulebook.pdf">Essentials Kit Rulebook</a>, the <a href="https://media.wizards.com/2018/dnd/downloads/DnD_BasicRules_2018.pdf">Basic Rules</a> for a bit more in-depth explanation, or you can buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Players-Handbook-Dungeons-Dragons-Wizards/dp/0786965606">Player's Handbook</a> for the best explanation. You’ll also want to find out from your Dungeon Master what setting you will be in. The setting can range from modern, medieval, futuristic, feudal japan, anything really. Next, you’ll need to know what skills are, how combat works, and what your character can do. If this is your first time, using a pre-generated character will make this easier for you. You just have to determine the character’s personality.</p>
                    <p>Second off, you need to understand what exactly your role is. As a player, you are going to be a hero (or villain) who will be undergoing incredible and dangerous adventures. You, the player, will need to describe what you would like to do. The Dungeon Master will then describe your actions and their outcome (a roll might be necessary depending on what you would like to do). This is the fundamental stepping stone of your role as a player.</p>
                    <p>The final step is to have fun! If you have your sheet ready, a basic idea of how to play, and a group, you are almost ready to play this wonderful game of D&D!</p>
